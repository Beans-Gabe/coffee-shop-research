## Problem Denfinition 
COVID-19 changed how costumers interact with different hospitality/service establishments but we will be examining coffee shops in particular. This study assess whether customers felt safer when they saw staff actively cleaning tables, machines, and counter tops at the coffee shops.


## Research Objectives 
- Determine if the effect of visible sanitation and COVID-19 prevention steps being implemented helped gain costumers trust.
- Identify which coffee shops during COVID-19 were trending.


## Importance of the Topic
- These behaviors allow coffee shops to understand and come up with the necessary strategies to improve service. 


## Methods 
- **Data set**: Coffee shop visits during COVID-19.
- **Data set**: Choosing a coffee shop that practiced COVID-19 prevention rules. 
- **Data set**: How long was the visit at the coffee shop. 
- **Independent Variable (IV)**: Does costumer perception of the presence of visible sanitation/COVID-19 prevention measures affect which coffee shop they choose (Yes/No).
- **Dependent Variable (DV)**: Number of daily costumers and customer preference for safety measures.  
- **Plan for Data Wrangling**: Filter data set for 'Indicating the degree to which you agree or disagree with each of the following statements regarding your behaviors when you stayed in a coffee shop during March 2020-May 2021'. 
- **Plan for Data Visualization**: Scatter Plot showing the relationship between safety preference score and costumer visits.

## RQ2 / H2  (Cynthia)
**RQ:**  Did coffee shop chains have different protocols than independent shops?

**Hypothesis:** Coffee shop chains implemented stricter and more standardized COVID-19 protocols than independent coffee shops due to corporate policies and liability concerns.

**Why?:**
-Chains typically follow corporate-wide mandates that ensure uniformity.
-Large businesses are more exposed to legal and public scrutiny, so they tend to enforce stricter safety measures.
-Independently owned coffee shops may have had more freedom to adapt based on local customer expectations rather than rigid corporate rules.


### IV's and DV's

IV: Type of Coffee Shop (Categorical: Chain vs. Independent)
-This is the factor that determines differences in COVID-19 protocols.
-Can classify coffee shops in your dataset as either "Chain" or "Independent."

DV: Strictness/Standardization of COVID-19 Protocols
Popssible ways to be measured:
-Number of enforced protocols (mask mandates, seating restrictions, contactless payment, temperature checks)
-Level of enforcement (corporate-mandated vs. discretionary policies)
-Consistency across locations (chains might have uniform policies, while independents might vary)
