## Problem Denfinition 
COVID-19 changed how costumers interact with different hospitality/service establishments but we will be examining coffee shops in particular. This study assesses whether customers felt safer when they saw staff actively cleaning tables, machines, and counter tops at the coffee shops.


## Research Objectives 
- Determine if the effect of visible sanitation and COVID-19 prevention steps being implemented helped gain costumers trust.
- Identify which coffee shops during COVID-19 were trending.


## Importance of the Topic
- These behaviors allow coffee shops to understand and come up with the necessary strategies to improve service. 


## Methods 
- **Data set**: Coffee shop visits during COVID-19.
- **Data set**: Choosing a coffee shop that practiced COVID-19 prevention rules. 
- **Data set**: How long was the visit to the coffee shop?

## RQ1 & H1 (Gabriel)
**RQ:** Were people taking the proper precautions and COVID-19 prevention steps when out in these hospitality establishments, in particular coffee shops? For example, were they carrying and using their mask and hand sanitizer, did they frequently was their hands, and made efforts to get vaccinated? 

**H1:** Individuals who visited coffee shops during the COVID-19 pandemic were more likely to take proper precautions, such as wearing masks, using hand sanitizer, and practicing hygiene when these establishments enforced strict safety measures. 

**Independent Variable(IV):** Does costumer perception of the presence of visible sanitation/COVID-19 prevention measures affect which coffee shop they choose (Yes/No).

**Dependent Variable(DV):** Number of daily customers and the preference for safety measures for each customer. 

**Plan for Data Wrangling:** Filter the data set for 'Indicating the degree to which you agree or disagree with each of the following statements regarding your behaviors when you stayed in a coffee shop during March 2020- May 2021'. 

**Plan for Data Visualization:** Scatter Plot showing the relationship between safety preference score and customer visits.

## RQ2 / H2  (Cynthia)
**RQ:**  Did coffee shop chains have protocols different from independent shops?

**Hypothesis:** Coffee shop chains implemented stricter and more standardized COVID-19 protocols than independent coffee shops due to corporate policies and liability concerns.

**Why?:**
-Chains typically follow corporate-wide mandates that ensure uniformity.
-Large businesses are more exposed to legal and public scrutiny, so they tend to enforce stricter safety measures.
-Independently owned coffee shops may have had more freedom to adapt based on local customer expectations rather than rigid corporate rules.


### IVs and DVs

IV: Type of Coffee Shop (Categorical: Chain vs. Independent)
-This is the factor that determines differences in COVID-19 protocols.
-Can classify coffee shops in your dataset as either "Chain" or "Independent."

DV: Strictness/Standardization of COVID-19 Protocols
Possible ways to be measured:
-Number of enforced protocols (mask mandates, seating restrictions, contactless payment, temperature checks)
-Level of enforcement (corporate-mandated vs. discretionary policies)
-Consistency across locations (chains might have uniform policies, while independents might vary)

### Plan for Data Visualization

1. Bar Charts – Comparing Protocol Adoption 
Purpose: Show the percentage of coffee shops (chains vs. independents) that adopted each protocol. 
X-axis: Types of protocols (masks, contactless payment, seating limits)
Y-axis: Percentage of coffee shops enforcing each protocol
Color: Chain vs. Independent

2. Box Plot – Protocol Strictness Distribution
Purpose: Show the spread of strictness scores for chains vs. independent coffee shops.
X-axis: Coffee shop type (Chain vs. Independent)
Y-axis: Strictness score (sum of protocols enforced)

3. Heatmap – Correlation Between Visitations & Protocols
Purpose: Show how strictness of protocols impacted customer visitations.
X-axis: Strictness levels (low, medium, high)
Y-axis: Change in visitations (%)




## RQ3 / H3  (Rozalyn)
**RQ:**  Are people who believe they have underlying health problems more likely to wear a mask in a coffee shop?

**Hypothesis:** People who believe they have underlying health problems are more likely to wear a mask in a coffee shop. 

**Why?:** 
Individuals with underlying health problems are more susceptible to COVID-19, and these underlying problems can cause it to have worse effects and create complications in one's health. 

### IVs and DVs

IV: Presence of Underlying Health Issue
-The factor that affects whether or not individuals wear a mask
-Can classify as either "has underlying health problem (UHP)" or "does not have (UHP)"
DV: Wearing a Mask in a Coffee Shop
- This factor is responsive to whether or not subjects believe they have an underlying health problem.
- Can be classified as "did wear mask" or "did not wear mask"

### Plan for Data Wrangling
- Believers
- First, filter the data for all particpant ids that answered yes to uhc2.
- Then, cross reference the filtered participant ids that answered yes to uhc2 to their likelihood that they will wear a mask in a coffee shop(past_behvr2_1).

- Non-Believers
- First, filter the data for all particpant ids that answered no to uhc2.
- Then, cross reference the filtered participant ids that answered no to uhc2 to their likelihood that they will wear a mask in a coffee shop(past_behvr2_1).


### Plan for Data Visualization
- One bar chart that takes the particpant ids from those who believe they have an underlying condition and compare them to the likelihood that they wear a mask in a coffee shop.

- A second bar chart that takes the particpant ids from those who don't believe they have an underlying condition and compare them to the likelihood that they wear a mask in a coffee shop.

## RQ5 / H5 (Tatianna)

**RQ:** Did coffee shops enforce sanitation protocols? 

**Hypothesis:** Coffee shops with poster reminders about sanitation do enforce protocols. 

**Reasoning:** The posters serve as encouragement for both staff and customers, therefore encouraging the enforcement of sanitation protocols as well with emphasis in safety. 

### IVs and DVs

IV: Customer/Staff Health & Poster 
- The health of customers and staff as well as posters will determine the sanitary enforcement, being either healthy and good if enforced or unhealthy and suffering if not enforced 
- Both of these variables are classified as independent because they change the outcome and are not the dependents 

DV: Sanitation Enforcement 
- This factor is both the resulting aspect we are studying for to answer the RQ as well as the solitary decisor for the cofee shops' data 
- This depends on the other two factors of customer/staff health and the posters' enforcement of protocols
