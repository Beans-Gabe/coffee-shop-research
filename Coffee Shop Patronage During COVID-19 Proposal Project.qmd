## Problem Definition 
COVID-19 changed how customers interact with different hospitality/service establishments but we will be examining coffee shops in particular. This study assesses whether customers felt safer when they saw staff actively cleaning tables, machines, and counter tops at the coffee shops.


## Research Objectives 
- Determine if the effect of visible sanitation and COVID-19 prevention steps being implemented helped gain customers trust.
- Identify which coffee shops during COVID-19 were trending.
- Identify which age groups were the most frequent visitors of coffee shops during the pandemic. 

## Importance of the Topic
- These behaviors allow coffee shops to understand and come up with the necessary strategies to improve service. 


## Methods 
- **Data set**: Coffee shop visits during COVID-19.
- **Data set**: Choosing a coffee shop that practiced COVID-19 prevention rules. 
- **Data set**: How long was the visit to the coffee shop?

## RQ1 & H1 
**RQ:** Were people taking the proper precautions and COVID-19 prevention steps when out in these hospitality establishments, in particular coffee shops? For example, were they carrying and using their mask and hand sanitizer, did they frequently wash their hands, and made efforts to get vaccinated? 

**H1:** Individuals who visited coffee shops during the COVID-19 pandemic were more likely to take proper precautions, such as wearing masks, using hand sanitizer, and practicing hygiene when these establishments enforced strict safety measures. 

**Independent Variable(IV):** Does customer perception of the presence of visible sanitation/COVID-19 prevention measures affect which coffee shop they choose (Yes/No).

**Dependent Variable(DV):** Number of daily customers and the preference for safety measures for each customer. 

**Plan for Data Wrangling:** Filter the data set for 'Indicating the degree to which you agree or disagree with each of the following statements regarding your behaviors when you stayed in a coffee shop during March 2020- May 2021'. 

**Plan for Data Visualization:** Scatter Plot showing the relationship between safety preference score and customer visits.

## RQ2 / H2  
**RQ:**  Did coffee shop chains have protocols different from independent shops?

**Hypothesis:** Coffee shop chains implemented stricter and more standardized COVID-19 protocols than independent coffee shops due to corporate policies and liability concerns.

### IVs and DVs

1. IV: Type of Coffee Shop (Categorical: Chain vs. Independent).    
- This is the factor that determines differences in COVID-19 protocols.    
- Can classify coffee shops in the dataset as either "Chain" or "Independent."    

2. DV: Strictness/Standardization of COVID-19 Protocols    
- Number of enforced protocols (mask mandates, seating restrictions, contactless payment, temperature checks)      
- Level of enforcement (corporate-mandated vs. discretionary policies)    
- Consistency across locations (chains might have uniform policies, while independents might vary)    

### Plan for Data Wrangling  
- Filter for relevant variables
- Fix inconsistencies
- Time period standardization
- Create a Protocol Strictness Score

### Plan for Data Visualization
1. Box Plot – Protocol Strictness Distribution
- Purpose: Show the spread of strictness scores for chains vs. independent coffee shops.
- X-axis: Coffee shop type (Chain vs. Independent)
- Y-axis: Strictness score (sum of protocols enforced)

2. Heatmap – Correlation Between Visitations & Protocols
- Purpose: Show how strictness of protocols impacted customer visitations.
- X-axis: Strictness levels (low, medium, high)
- Y-axis: Change in visitations (%)




## RQ3 / H3  
**RQ:**  Are people who believe they have underlying health problems more likely to wear a mask in a coffee shop?

**Hypothesis:** People who believe they have underlying health problems are more likely to wear a mask in a coffee shop. 

**Why?:** 
Individuals with underlying health problems are more susceptible to COVID-19, and these underlying problems can cause it to have worse effects and create complications in one's health. 

### IVs and DVs

IV: Presence of Underlying Health Issue  
- The factor that affects whether or not individuals wear a mask  
- Can classify as either "has underlying health problem (UHP)" or "does not have (UHP)"  
DV: Wearing a Mask in a Coffee Shop  
- This factor is responsive to whether or not subjects believe they have an underlying health problem.  
- Can be classified as "did wear mask" or "did not wear mask"  

### Plan for Data Wrangling
- Believers
- First, filter the data for all particpant ids that answered yes to uhc2.
- Then, cross reference the filtered participant ids that answered yes to uhc2 to their likelihood that they will wear a mask in a coffee shop(past_behvr2_1).

- Non-Believers
- First, filter the data for all particpant ids that answered no to uhc2.
- Then, cross reference the filtered participant ids that answered no to uhc2 to their likelihood that they will wear a mask in a coffee shop(past_behvr2_1).


### Plan for Data Visualization
- One bar chart that takes the particpant ids from those who believe they have an underlying condition and compare them to the likelihood that they wear a mask in a coffee shop.

- A second bar chart that takes the particpant ids from those who don't believe they have an underlying condition and compare them to the likelihood that they wear a mask in a coffee shop.

## RQ4 / H4  
**RQ:** Did age distribution affect the willingness to visit coffee shops during Covid-19?

**Hypothesis:** Younger individuals (e.g., 18-34) were more willing to visit coffee shops during the pandemic than older individuals (e.g., 35+) due to differing risk perceptions and health concerns.

**Why?:**  
- Older individuals face more health concerns, so they were more cautious about visiting public areas such as coffee shops.  
- Younger individuals rely more on coffee shops for their daily lives and social activities, so they are more likely to visit even during the pandemic.  

### IVs and DVs
**Independent Variable (IV):**      
- `age.x`: Participant age (continuous, 18-74 years)  
- Will categorize into groups of 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55+
**Dependent Variables (DVs):**    
- `beh_int1`: Self-reported willingness to visit (1-7 scale)  
- `duration`: Actual visit duration (ordinal categories)

### Plan for Data Wrangling  
- Convert continuous age to categorical groups
- Clean duration categories by removing unrealistic values  
- Check for missing data and handle appropriately
- Compare average willingness scores across age groups  
- Analyze visit duration patterns by generation

### Plan for Data Visualization
1. **Grouped bar chart:** Comparing visit duration frequency across age groups  
2. **Boxplot:** Showing distribution of willingness scores for each age category
3. **Scatter Plot:** Examining correlation between age and willingness scores

## RQ5 / H5 

**RQ:** Did coffee shops enforce sanitation protocols? 

**Hypothesis:** Coffee shops with poster reminders about sanitation do enforce protocols. 

**Reasoning:** The posters serve as encouragement for both staff and customers, therefore encouraging the enforcement of sanitation protocols as well with emphasis in safety. 

### IVs and DVs

IV: Customer/Staff Health & Poster   
- The health of customers and staff as well as posters will determine the sanitary enforcement, being either healthy and good if enforced or unhealthy and suffering if not enforced   
- Both of these variables are classified as independent because they change the outcome and are not the dependents   

DV: Sanitation Enforcement     
- This factor is both the resulting aspect we are studying for to answer the RQ as well as the solitary decisor for the cofee shops' data       
- This depends on the other two factors of customer/staff health and the posters' enforcement of protocols   

### Plan for Data Wrangling 
- Filter coffee shop appearances by category and numerical value of sanitation reminders present   
- Filter positive health of staff/customers   
- Compare the data   

### Plan for Data Visualization
- Table presentation for categorical data   
- Bar chart for sanitation reminders   
- Bar chart for health recordings of staff/customer   
- Grouped bar chart overall for comparison   


## Conclusion
Our study will examine the impact of COVID-19 cleaning regulations on coffee shop visits. We will also take into consideration key insights such as customer trust, age, business types, and health behaviors. From analyzing and displaying the data, we will be able to identify trends that indicate the impact of safety regulations on people's decisions.
